## Contributing as a FCC Seoul Collaborator

Any contributions to this repo **must** follow our code formatting and linting rules. The easiest way is to use the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension for your code editor. Most of the members use VS Code but you're welcome to use other editors. Pull requests that don't follow Prettier's linting rules will not be merged.

Collaborators should contribute by **making a new branch** instead of forking this repo. This makes it easier for you and others to compare different branches within the same repo. When you're done making changes, submit a pull request to the Free-Code-Camp-Seoul repo.

#### When creating a new branch, please let us know what you're going to work on by following these naming conventions:
- `git checkout -b feature-githubusername` (where "feature" represents what you're working on)
- example: `git checkout -b navbar-simonhlee97`
