<p>Lately we've been meeting at A Twosome Place right outside Sinnonhyeon station, exit 3, 투썸플레이스 신논현역점. Find it on Kakao Maps <a href="https://place.map.kakao.com/27465316">here</a> or Naver Maps <a href="https://map.naver.com/v5/entry/place/37572989">here</a>. We're always looking for good venues, though!</p>
